You could find the code for each section.
There are folders for the specific sections or 
the entries in the [releases page](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Application-Building-with-GraphQL/releases),
which also gives you a nice view for seeing the changes compared to that previous section (e.g. [sec4 compared to sec3](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Application-Building-with-GraphQL/commit/95039f21919f75ea541671a42f57128a4d8ca889) )
or in the git history [via tags, e.g. section-3](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Hands-on-Application-Building-with-GraphQL/tree/section-3)

All steps are also committed separately, so you can see each sub-section in the [commit history](./commits/master) e.g. 
[3.3 Integrate Apollo Framework](https://github.com/lowsky/Hands-on-Application-Building-with-GraphQL/commit/e50ae20a8272a5ebdaea97d84521c6a57a39b188)
